# Project-Fetch
Fetch is a symmetrical point to point tracking system Phoenix Sub-Orbital Rocketry developed using the 915Mhz LoRa frequency and protocol. As well as being symmetrical, the system is completely self-contained with an onboard LiPo battery, OLED screen and signal processing capabilities. Fetch works based on a unique "Hot, Cold" tracking system spcially developed by Phoenix Sub-Orbital Rocketry which allows for many features such as complete, inertial tracking, aka no need for GPS! for more information, read the read me file and user manual.
