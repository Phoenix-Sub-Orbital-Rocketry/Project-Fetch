# About Fetch
Fetch is a symmetrical point to point tracking system Phoenix Sub-Orbital Rocketry developed using the 915Mhz LoRa frequency and protocol. As well as being symmetrical, the system is completely self-contained with an onboard LiPo battery, OLED screen and signal processing capabilities. Fetch works based on a unique "Hot, Cold" tracking system spcially developed by Phoenix Sub-Orbital Rocketry which allows for many features such as complete, inertial tracking, aka no need for GPS! Fetch was orgininally designed as a part of a larger Flight Computer system for High Powered, Sub-Orbital Rockets before being spun off into it's own system after it's creator realized it's potential as a stand alone system.  For more information, read the file and user manual.

# How to Use the Files in This Repository
The creator of Project Fetch has decided to make all of the files nessisary for it's creation, open source and free in this repository. The files in this repository include the Gerber files and BOM for the main PCB, The STL file for the case, the ardunio code for the entire system and the assembly and use instructions. Also inluded is the STL flies and assembly instructions for a 4 node, 3D printable Yagi antenna that is still in development but may become a part of the standard Fetch kit.
